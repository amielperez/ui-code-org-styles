# 101* ways to organize your front-end project
(_* - Not really_) 
* Components are written in vanilla JS to make this as stripped-down as possible
* JS codes are all written in ES6 to take advantage of new features/syntactical sugar

## Instructions
* Each structure is in its own branch
* Switch to a branch you want to demo, e.g., using `git fetch` and `git checkout`
* Run `node server` to run this on port 8080, or `node server XXXX` to run it in some other port `XXXX`
